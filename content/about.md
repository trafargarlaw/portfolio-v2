I'm a self-taught software developer with a passion for front-end development
and a love for learning new technologies. Since teaching myself to code in 2019,
I've spent countless hours reading, practicing, and experimenting with different
languages, frameworks, and tools.
Some of my key skills include proficiency in front-end technologies such as React
and Vue,as well as experience working with popular back-end frameworks such as
Node.js Express and Nest.js.
In addition to my technical skills, I'm also known for my strong work ethic and
ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies.
One of my biggest passions as a software developer is the theory and principles
behind the technologies we use. I find it incredibly exciting to read and learn
about the latest advancements in the field, and I'm always looking for
opportunities to deepen my understanding of the underlying principles of
software development.
At 26, I'm still relatively new to the world of software development, but
I'm eager to continue learning and growing in my career. I'm always open to new
challenges and opportunities, and I'm excited to see where my passion for coding
will take me in the future.
